                <div style="max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">
                    <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 2; color: var(--text-light); margin-bottom: 30px;">
                        St. Mary's Higher Secondary School Mawpdang has a very long and illustrious history of its establishment. While the exact date remains shrouded in mystery, the roots of this esteemed institution trace back to the arrival of the first Christian missionaries from Europe in the early 20th century. It is generally believed that the school might have begun its journey sometime around 1922, when the Salesian missionaries first arrived in the region with a vision to bring education and development to this remote village.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 2; color: var(--text-light); margin-bottom: 30px;">
                        The village of Mawpdang is deeply indebted to the Salesian missionaries from Europe who took keen interest in bringing education and holistic development to this region. It was in 1930 that Fr. Constantine Vendrame, widely known as the "Apostle of Khasis," established the Lower Primary section of the school. This marked the beginning of an educational journey that would transform the lives of countless young people in the region. In 1989, the Lower Primary section was officially inserted into the deficit pattern by the Government of Meghalaya, recognizing its contribution to elementary education in the state.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 2; color: var(--text-light); margin-bottom: 30px;">
                        In a remarkably short span of time, the Lower Primary School evolved into an Upper Primary School, reflecting the growing educational needs of the community. In 2002, the institution was included into the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) pattern, further strengthening its commitment to universal elementary education. Responding to the persistent demands of the local community, the Secondary Section of the school was finally opened in 2014, completing the educational chain and providing students with opportunities to pursue their studies up to the Secondary level without leaving their hometown.
                    </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 2; color: var(--text-light); margin-bottom: 30px;">
                        Since then, St. Mary's Higher Secondary School has played a pivotal role in shaping the lives of hundreds of young people from Mawpdang and surrounding villages. The school has become a beacon of excellence in education and culture, well-known for its outstanding achievements in academics as well as in socio-cultural and co-curricular activities. The institution takes pride in imparting quality education to children and guiding them to become responsible, free, and honest citizens of India, while instilling in them strong moral, social, cultural, and religious values.

                    <p style="font-size: 1.05rem; line-height: 2; color: var(--text-light);">
                        Over the decades, the school has grown from strength to strength, becoming a heritage and an asset to the locality. It continues to uphold the vision of its founding fathers—providing holistic education that nurtures not just academic excellence but also character building, spiritual growth, and social responsibility.

                            The year 2025 marks a significant milestone not only for St. Mary's Higher Secondary School, Mawpdang, but also for the newly established Mawpdang Parish. With the official declaration of Mawpdang as an independent parish in 2024, the community witnessed not only spiritual growth but also a renewed commitment towards education and the future of its youth.
                        </p>
                        <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 2; color: var(--text-light); margin-bottom: 25px;">
                            In response to the growing needs of the students and the aspirations of the people, St. Mary's Higher Secondary School proudly inaugurates Class XI this academic session 2025–2026. This long-awaited step is a reflection of the parish's dedication to providing holistic education grounded in faith, discipline, and excellence. The opening of the Higher Secondary section, starting with the Arts stream, was made possible through the collective effort and prayers of the parishioners, the Parish Priest, the school management, and the people who have tirelessly served the school and the community.
                        </p>
                        <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 2; color: var(--text-light); margin-bottom: 25px;">
                            This development also stands as a witness to the vision of the pioneers who dreamt of seeing the school grow alongside the parish. With the Higher Secondary now in place, students from Mawpdang and the surrounding villages no longer need to venture far to continue their education after Class X. This ensures that the youth remain close to their roots while receiving quality education in a nurturing and value-based environment.
                        </p>
                        <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 2; color: var(--text-light);">
                            As Mawpdang Parish begins its journey as a beacon of faith, St. Mary's Higher Secondary School stands proudly as one of its first fruits—nurturing young minds, strengthening the Church, and contributing to the bright future of Mawpdang.
